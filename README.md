# Firing Line

**Firing Line** is a Warhammer 40K weapon simulation tool designed for players who want to analyze weapon profiles, compare target interactions, and get an idea of how dice rolls affect combat results. With Firing Line, you can quickly test various weapons against different targets, get insights into damage output, and refine your battle strategies. For now this is only the backend API, but a front-end client will be added where you can add new profiles and targets and test them out via the web application. 

## Features

- **Simulated Dice Rolls**: Calculate the probability of different outcomes based on simulated dice rolls.
- **Customizable Weapon Profiles**: Input and test various weapon characteristics, such as Strength, AP, Damage, and more.
- **Target Profiles**: Add and modify target profiles with Toughness, Armor Saves, and special rules.
- **Detailed Results Analysis**: See expected average damage, hit and wound probabilities, and the effects of rerolls.
- **Battle Stats Comparison**: Compare multiple weapon and target profiles side-by-side for quick insights.
